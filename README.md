# Programming-I---Module-3
CSU Global, Programming I

This repository contains the documentation for the Java application that was created for CSU Globalâ€™s Programming I, Module 3 assignment. The application takes user input, uses If and Switch statements to correctly calculate the tax withholding amount for a fictional customer, and prints this information to the screen. The attached PDF file gives a brief overview of the pseudocode, source code, and associated screenshots for the assignment.
